Notes:

* Kernels prior to 2.6.22 do not support poll() on /dev/mcelog.  In that
  case, the polling intervals of the kernel and of mced will limit the
  rate at which MCEs can be logged.  To get better resolution, decrease
  these intervals.

* Not every system tracks a "current boot number".  For those that do, the
  -b (--bootnum) option can be used.  Tracking a boot number can help to
  identify crashes that might be related to MCEs.

* mced does not try to decode MCEs.  If you want that, you should try
  Andi Kleen's mcelog tool (http://freshmeat.net/projects/mcelog/) or the
  simple generic MCE decoder included in this package (mce_decode).
